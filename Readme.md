# Intro
Python is a dynamic lang and its design is what makes it very flexible.
The typing module and mypy tool for checking static types make static typing possible.\
This makes it less possible to push errors on bugs into production code.

## Mypy Tool 
Mypy is an important tool in checking for static types.
One goes to the terminal keys mypy and then the path to that file.
You will get the errors showing what datatype has been violated.
Test it out.
I have stated the errors to expect on each file as a comment at the end of each file.

## Typing module
Typing is a module with all kinds of types that can be used to declare variables, function parameters and return types and class attributes and methods return types.

### nom.py
There are main types used in all prog langs int, float and str 

### opy.py
There is an optional type . Useful when you don't know the return type of a function or method in class. 

### call.py 
There is a callable type.
